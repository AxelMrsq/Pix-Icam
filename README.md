PixIcam

PixIcam is a decentralized pixel place project built on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides users with an interactive and collaborative art experience, allowing them to place pixels on a shared canvas in exchange for GoerliETH. The project leverages Solidity smart contracts and a decentralized application (dApp) developed with JavaScript and Ether.js.

🚀 Features

Decentralized Canvas – Users can place pixels on the shared online canvas.

Blockchain-Powered – Transactions are handled through a Solidity smart contract deployed on the Goerli Ethereum test network.

Hands-on Learning – Participants gain experience with blockchain, smart contracts, and dApp development.

Collaborative Experience – Users contribute to a communal artwork while interacting with blockchain technology.

🎯 Goal of the Project

The main objective of PixIcam is to introduce students to blockchain technology by providing a fun and engaging way to interact with smart contracts and decentralized applications. This project demonstrates real-world use cases of blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies, showcasing its potential for creative and educational applications.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Solidity – Smart contract development

Ethereum (Goerli Testnet) – Blockchain network for deployment

Ether.js – Interfacing with the Ethereum blockchain

JavaScript – dApp front-end development

🎨 How It Works

Connect your MetaMask wallet (Goerli Testnet required).

Select a pixel on the canvas.

Pay the required GoerliETH fee via MetaMask.

The smart contract updates the blockchain, reflecting your pixel placement.
